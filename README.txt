This project proposes two potential improvements on the basic geographic forwarding (GF) scheme in ad hoc wireless networks. In the original
GF scheme, each node selects the neighbor that has the shortest distance to the destination as the next hop for the forwarding. Two proposed
improvements are grid routing and multi hop neighbor selection. The grid routing divides the environment into grids and rather than forwarding
to the neighbor closest to the destination, each node selects the zone for the next hop and caches information about the next hop for each 
neighboring zone. In the multi hop scheme, each node not only search for the next hop among its neighbors, but also asks its neighbors to select
the next next hop, hoping to reach the optimal node in two hops. Both schemes are measured against the original GF scheme in terms of the number
of broadcasting messages and geographical calculations. Future works include testing in more sophisticated environments and integrate with a
network simulator with all layers implemented.
